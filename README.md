# Gliph

Gliph is a **g**raph **li**brary for **PH**P. It provides graph building blocks and datastructures for use in other applications. It is designed with performance in mind, but primarily to provide a sane interface. Graphs are hard enough to work with without an arcane API that makes it worse.

## Acknowledgements

This library draws heavy inspiration from the [C++ Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc).
